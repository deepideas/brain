**deepideas brain** is an interactive encyclopedia of the human brain that allows you to navigate
through the hierarchical anatomical structure of the brain with ease.
It is primarily intended for students and researchers who want to explore the brain
and make sense of the large vocabulary used in brain anatomy, which includes many synonyms
for the same regions, partially overlapping regions and regions nested within other regions.
